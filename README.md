# scoreboard

A toy scoreboard app inspired by the one that I remember from high school.

## Interesting Challenges

These were some of the more interesting programming challenges.

2.  How can we make the individual lightbulbs look like lightbulbs?
3.  How can we make the values cycle?
4.  How do we play sounds?
5.  How do we keep track of the clock timer?

8.  How can we keep the computed properties as terse as possible?
9.  How can we make everything totally self-explanatory?
10. How can we leverage existing NPM modules easily?

### Not Done

1. How can we update the scoreboard remotely?
